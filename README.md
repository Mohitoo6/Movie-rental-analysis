**Approach:**  
1. **Data Cleaning and Integration:**  
   - Extracted data from multiple relational tables such as `rental`, `customer`, and `inventory` using SQL queries.
   - Joined and transformed datasets to create a unified view for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Performed in-depth analysis to identify rental trends, customer preferences, and underperforming movies.  
   - Segmented customers based on rental frequency and identified top-performing genres.  

3. **Actionable Insights and Recommendations:**  
   - Leveraged SQL queries to derive metrics like rentals per day, top customers, and unreturned movies.
   - Visualized key metrics to enhance interpretation and decision-making.

**Key Findings:**  
- **Daily Rentals:** Analyzed rental patterns to identify peak days for rentals.  
- **Top Customers:** Identified the top 10 customers contributing the highest rental volumes, offering potential for loyalty programs.  
- **Unpopular Movies:** Pinpointed movies with minimal rentals, recommending them for discontinuation to optimize inventory.  
- **Sci-Fi Dominance:** Highlighted Sci-Fi as a top genre with several popular titles like "Armageddon Lost" and "Citizen Shrek."  
- **Unreturned Rentals:** Detected a list of movies not returned by customers, along with their details for follow-up reminders.

**Tools Used:**  
- **Programming Language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Libraries for Data Analysis:** pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy  
- **Database Queries:** SQL for extracting and transforming data  
- **Visualization Libraries:** matplotlib, seaborn

**Recommendations:**  
1. **Inventory Optimization:** Discontinue unpopular movies with minimal rentals to reduce operational costs.  
2. **Customer Retention:** Launch loyalty programs targeting top customers to increase engagement and retention.  
3. **Return Follow-Ups:** Implement an automated reminder system for unreturned movies to improve inventory availability.  
4. **Promote Sci-Fi Genre:** Increase the availability and marketing of popular Sci-Fi titles to maximize revenue.  
5. **Peak Day Strategies:** Optimize staffing and promotional offers during peak rental days to enhance customer experience.
